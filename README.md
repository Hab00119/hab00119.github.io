# Personal website (Hab00119)

This repository is a Hugo site generated from the Hugo Blox Builder starter for an academic CV / personal site.

## Development

Requirements:
- Hugo (Extended) >= 0.148.2 (image processing required)
- Node.js >= 18 (for Tailwind CSS)

Quick start:
- npm install
- hugo server -D

Notes:
- CI installs Node dependencies before building so Tailwind is available in the GitHub Actions environment.
