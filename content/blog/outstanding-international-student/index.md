I am honored to be recognized as the Most Outstanding International Graduate Student at Boise State University. This award, announced by the Center for Global Learning, celebrates international students who demonstrate exceptional academic achievement, research contributions, and commitment to the university community.

This recognition reflects the dedication and hard work throughout my doctoral journey, and I am grateful to the faculty, staff, and fellow students who supported me along the way.
