I am thrilled to announce the successful completion of my PhD in Computing from Boise State University! My dissertation focused on developing chemometric and machine learning methods for spectroscopic analysis of dairy proteins.

This achievement represents years of research, collaboration, and innovation in applying computational methods to real-world agricultural and food science problems. I am grateful to my advisor Dr. Timothy Andersen, my committee members, and all my collaborators at the Food and Dairy Innovation Center for their guidance and support throughout this journey.

I look forward to continuing this research as a Postdoctoral Researcher and contributing to advances in dairy data science and analytical chemistry.
