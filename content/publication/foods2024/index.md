Protein content variation in milk can impact the quality and consistency of dairy products, necessitating access to in-line real time monitoring. In this work, we present a chemometric approach for the qualitative and quantitative monitoring of β-lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin using mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR). We employed Hotelling T2 and Q-residual for outlier detection, automated preprocessing using nippy, conducted wavenumber selection with genetic algorithms, and evaluated multiple chemometric models including support vector regression (SVR), which showed superior performance for this dataset.
