abstract: Decline in the theoretical and empirical review of Brownian motion is worth noticing, not just because its relevance lies in the field of mathematical physics but due to unavailability of statistical technique. The ongoing debate on transport phenomenon and thermal performance of various fluids in the presence of haphazard motion of tiny particles as explained by Albert Einstein using kinetic theory and Robert Brown is further clinched in this report. This report presents the outcome of detailed inspections of the significance of Brownian motion on the flow of various fluids as reported in forty-three (43) published articles using the method of slope linear regression through the data point. The technique of slope regression through the data points of each physical property of the flow and Brownian motion parameter was established and used to generate four forest plots. The outcome of the study indicates that an increase in Brownian motion corresponds to an enhancement of haphazard motion of tiny particles. In view of this, there would always be a significant difference between the corresponding effects when Brownian motion is small and large in magnitude. Maximum heat transfer rate can be achieved due to Brownian motion in the presence of thermal radiation, thermal convective and mass convective at the wall in three-dimensional flow.

summary: Meta-analysis of Brownian motion effects on fluid dynamics using slope regression through 43 published articles.
