abstract: Differential equations, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics are few among the fundamental subjects in mechanical sciences. Considering the contributions of published articles to the body of knowledge on boundary layer analysis together with heat and mass transfer, it is noteworthy that validation of results, theoretical/conceptual review and empirical review have been on decreasing trends in quality. In this report, a systematic review procedure on the effects of Grashof number and mixed convection parameter on the flow of various fluids is presented. After searching through the relevant literature systematically, 30 relevant articles were screened and reviewed for the study. Each of the accepted articles was coded using study characteristics and corresponding effects of the parameter were scrutinized. The outcomes of the systematic reviews of the parameter and forest plot are illustrated. An increase in the magnitude of buoyancy parameter corresponds to a moderate increase in the velocity but a decrease in the temperature distribution becomes apparent.

summary: Systematic review of 30 articles analyzing Grashof number effects on fluid flow and heat transfer.
