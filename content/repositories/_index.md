I maintain a number of open-source projects related to spectroscopy preprocessing, MLOps demos, and tooling for data engineering. Below are a few highlights — click through for code, READMEs and demos.

- **Gitchat** (https://github.com/habeeb3579/Gitchat) — A prototype chat interface for interacting with GitHub repositories (LangChain, FAISS demos).
- **interval-model-estimator** (https://github.com/habeeb3579/interval-model-estimator) — Feature selection methods for spectroscopy datasets; useful for chemometrics workflows.
- **Spectoprep** (https://github.com/habeeb3579/Spectoprep) — Preprocessing tools for spectral data and pipelines for reproducible spectroscopy analysis.
- **Opus2csv / Opus-converter** (https://github.com/habeeb3579/Opus2csv) — Command-line utilities to convert Opus binary spectral files to CSV / MAT / NPY formats.
- **cicd-mlops-demo** (https://github.com/habeeb3579/cicd-mlops-demo) — Demonstration repository for CI/CD in machine-learning projects (useful for reproducible ML workflows).
